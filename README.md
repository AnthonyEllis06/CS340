Q: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A: I like the way we created the dashboard using the tools like jupyter notebooks, jupyter dash and dash components to build the dashboard. I really like the way we developed the crud funtionality first to abstract the tool for later use. This was later super useful because I then understood how to use my own functions pretty well. I will use this approach in the future.

Q: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A: I really like the approach of giving us a tool to use such as api like dash and then some documentation supporting that tool. This is generally my prefered way to learn and implement my new knolege. I feel like we also did the back end first in this clas and other classes have had me do front end first and that is much harder in my opinion. 

Q: What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A: Computer Scientist research and learn about different parts of computer science so that they can apply them to use cases like Grazioso Salvaare.
